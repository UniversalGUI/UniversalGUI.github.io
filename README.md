# UGUI Website

The public website for the UGUI project. It consists of Templates, Tutorials, and Documentation.

* **[UGUI.io](http://ugui.io)**

To run this site locally install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and run `node server.js` or just double-click `server.bat` on Windows. Though most of the site can be ran locally without the need for the server to be running. It is mainly used for testing 404 pages.

If you install the [Editor Config](http://editorconfig.org/#download) plugin, you will automatically match the settings for this repo's files.
