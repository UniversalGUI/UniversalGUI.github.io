<h2>The Basics/Getting Started</h2>

<p>
  <span class="filter-nov">Before we get started, you'll need to know if your operating system is 32-Bit or 64-Bit to make sure you get the correct version of NW.js.</span>
  <span class="filter-nov filter-win">On Windows, right-click on "Computer" and go to properties, or just press "Windows Key + Pause/Break".</span>
  <span class="filter-nov filter-mac">On OSX, click the Apple icon in the top left of the screen and go to "About his Mac". Click on More Information. If you have an Intel Core Solo or Intel Core Duo, it's 32-Bit. Intel Core 2 Duo and all other Intel CPU's will mean you have a 64-Bit OS. For a full listing, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT3696">Apple's website</a>.</span>
  <span class="filter-nov filter-lin">On Ubuntu Linux, click the top right power icon and go to "About This Computer".</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span class="filter-nov">Once you know if your OS is 32-Bit or 64-Bit, download the correct version of [NW.js](http://nwjs.io). Then download a copy of [UGUI](http://ugui.io/#/download). After you extract the UGUI project folder from the zipped archive, tyu should rename the UGUI folder to whatever your project name is.</span>

<h3>Setting up your NW.js environment</h3>

<p>
  <span class="filter-nov">Once you've downloaded NW.js, extract it's contents from the zip archive. Find an appropriate place for it's folder. For the purposes of this documentation, and tutorials, we will presume you've placed the NW.js folder in specific location.</span>
  <span class="filter-nov filter-win">In Windows we'll assume you've placed it in the root of your C: drive and renamed the folder to <code>nw</code>.</span>
  <span class="filter-nov filter-mac">In OSX we assume you've placed it in your ???? and renamed the folder to <code>nw</code>.</span>
  <span class="filter-nov filter-lin">In Ubuntu we assume you've placed it in your ???? and renamed the folder to <code>nw</code>.</span>
